## Amazon Ray

**Ray provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.** 
Please see the [Latest Ray Docs](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

This repository serves as a staging area for ongoing enhancements to Ray focused on improving
its integration with AWS and other Amazon technologies. Associated large-scale refactoring, 
rearchitecture, or experimental changes to Ray will typically be released and vetted with the
open source community here prior to any subsequent contribution back to the 
[Ray Project](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

| Ray Wheel                                                                                                         | Base AMI                                     | AMI ID                | Region    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| [Linux Python 3.6](http://d168575n8y1h5x.cloudfront.net/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl)| AWS Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04, 64-bit) | ami-021a4a9fecf0763a0 | us-east-1 |
| [Linux Python 3.7](http://d168575n8y1h5x.cloudfront.net/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl)| AWS Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04, 64-bit) | ami-0583d277a9128066a | us-east-1 |
| [Linux Python 3.8](http://d168575n8y1h5x.cloudfront.net/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl) | AWS Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04, 64-bit) | ami-0f6490d5c89ecaaaf | us-east-1 |

All of the above AMIs have passed unit tests and EC2 cluster integration tests. To use any of the above AMIs,
first ensure that you're launching your Ray EC2 cluster in the same region as the AMI, then specify the AMI ID
to use with your cluster's head and worker nodes in your autoscaler config:

```yaml
provider:
  type: aws
  region: us-east-1
  availability_zone: us-east-1a

head_node:
  InstanceType: r5n.xlarge 
  ImageId: ami-0583d277a9128066a

worker_nodes:
  InstanceType: r5n.2xlarge 
  ImageId: ami-0583d277a9128066a
```

> Note that the Python 3.6 and 3.7 Ray wheels are installed in the default conda environment, while the Python 3.8
> Ray wheel is installed in the `ray_cp38` conda environment. This environment can be activated by running
> `conda activate ray_cp38`.

#### CloudWatch Integration
Each AMI also comes with the
[CloudWatch Unified Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/UseCloudWatchUnifiedAgent.html)
pre-installed and configured. The agent will automatically collect additional system level metrics for each EC2
instance in your Ray cluster and write Ray system logs out to corresponding CloudWatch log groups like
*amzn-ray-cp37-manylinux--ray_logs_out* and *amzn-ray-cp37-manylinux--ray_logs_err*.

Any logs written to `/tmp/ray/user/var/output/logs/*.info.log` will be automatically added to a corresponding
*amzn-ray-cp37-manylinux--ray_user_logs_info* CloudWatch log group, while logs written to
`/tmp/ray/user/var/output/logs/*.debug.log` will be added to a corresponding
*amzn-ray-cp37-manylinux--ray_user_logs_debug* log group.

> Although all of the above log groups include *cp37* in their name, the actual log group
> name depends on the Python version of the Ray wheel installed. For example, an AMI with the Python 3.6 Ray
> wheel installed will use *cp36* instead.

For log and metric publication to work you first need to ensure that the IAM role associated with your Ray
cluster EC2 instances is authorized to publish them. This can be done by attaching the following policy, replacing
`{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}` with your 12-digit AWS account ID and `{CP_VERSION}` with *36*, *37*, or *38* based on
the AMI's Ray wheel Python version:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "cloudwatch:namespace": "CWAgent"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:amzn-andes-ray-cp{CP_VERSION}-manylinux--ray_logs_out:*",
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:amzn-andes-ray-cp{CP_VERSION}-manylinux--ray_logs_err:*",
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:amzn-andes-ray-cp{CP_VERSION}-manylinux--ray_user_logs_debug:*",
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:amzn-andes-ray-cp{CP_VERSION}-manylinux--ray_user_logs_info:*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A tail can be acquired on all logs written to a CloudWatch log group by
 ensuring that you have the
 [AWS CLI V2+ installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
 and then running:
```sh
aws logs tail $log_group_name --follow
```

To disable the CloudWatch Unified Agent at cluster launch time, simply add the following setup command to your autoscaler
config YAML:

```yaml
setup_commands:
  - sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -m ec2 -a stop
```
